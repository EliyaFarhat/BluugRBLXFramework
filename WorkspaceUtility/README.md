# BluugRBLXFramework

Framework for creating Roblox experiences the right way.

## My Macros:

Organized file structure is important. Being able to see it accurately is a benefit.

When creating a new, empty, temporary file structure in the workspace, the VSCode explorer does not accurately reflect the change.

This macro solves that issue by placing a `.gitkeep` file in the newly created folder. After doing so, the VSCode explorer agrees with the actual file structure.

### Powershell:

```powershell
.\BluugRBLXFramework\StartFramework\WorkspaceUtility\create_folder_with_gitkeep.ps1
```
